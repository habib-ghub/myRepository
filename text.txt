This is to show what git can perform. Git is used most importantly for flexibility and collaborations.

To connect local repository with remote:
 git remote add origin "Url of your remote repository" 
To send local commits to to remote repository:
 git push origin master
To pull the changes from remote repo to local machine:
 git pull origin master
To create a copy of remote repo in local working directory:
git clone "url of remote repo"Programming with mosh is fun
